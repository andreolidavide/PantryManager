#  Pantry Manager
## Introduction
After a lot of tutorials and half-assed projects that never saw completion, I'm ready for my first "real world" application.
It's a very simple app designed to keep track of the items in your pantry, fridge and freezer to know exactly what you have available and to keep track of their expiry date. 
It's more of a learning project than something I would really publish, I'm just taking the opportunity to learn as I do.
## The App
Again, the app is super simple and only here as a learning exercise.
It's a food item tracker, you can enter all the food in your pantry, fridge and freezer, track their expiry date and be notified when they go bad.
The main objectives is to assist when grocery shopping, so that you know exactly what you have at home (which my dad considers very important), which in turns will help to:
- Prevent food waste
- Save money
### Features
Here are the features already implemented:
- List what is in your pantry, fridge, freezer and add, remove or modify items
### Planned features
Here is what I'm planning to implement:
- Data persistency --> this should be a given, but I prefered to build the basic functionalities first and then focus on persistence
- iCloud Sync
- Food categories
- Customize or add containers
### Known issues
